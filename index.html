    <p>
      As a computer enthusiast and technology professional, I've spent more than 30 years enjoying technology's evolution from a niche interest to near-ubiquitous facet of daily life. Playing (and configuring) DOS games in the 80s led to programming in Pascal and working with Windows in the 90s, desktop support at the turn of the century and then network administration and software design in the 2000s. 
    <br><br>
      I'm now taking the next step, from software design to development, with a focus on web applications. Core technologies that I'm learning include HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are being built upon to include libraries and frameworks like LESS, SASS and React and backend technologies like Node, Java, Python and SQL.

    <h2>Why Me?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Lets build the future together! If you have a need for a website or an idea for a web application, lets design it and show it to the world. Prior to my endeavor to become a full-stack developer, I already worked in software development as a designer for a clinical EMR for long-term care. I didn't know code then, and helped build a system that was ahead of its time. Now, I've started building skills to craft websites and web applications. Let me exercise this knowledge by putting it to work for you!
