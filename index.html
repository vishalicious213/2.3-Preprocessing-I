      As a computer enthusiast and technology professional, I've spent more than 30 years enjoying technology's evolution from a niche interest to near-ubiquitous facet of daily life. Playing (and configuring) games on DOS in the 80s led to programming and working with Windows in the 90s, desktop support at the turn of the century and then network administration and software design in the 2000s. I've come to admire iOS and Android's game-changing contributions to how people work, play and communicate, and welcome the public's embrace of smart technologies, including personal devices like smart phones and TVs and environmental tools like smart home devices and vehicles.
